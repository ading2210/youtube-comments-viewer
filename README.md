![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ading2210/youtube-comments-viewer/main/static/images/screenshot1.png)

This program gets the comments on a given Youtube video, which you can view in your browser. I mainly made this to bypass restricted mode on certain devices.

Demo: [https://youtube-comments-fetcher.uniqueostrich18.repl.co/](https://youtube-comments-fetcher.uniqueostrich18.repl.co/)

### Features:
 - Load the comments of a Youtube video
 - View the replies for a specific comment
 - View when a comment or reply was edited
 - Sort comments by date or popularity
